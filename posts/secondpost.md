### Questions
Are API's necessary for our project? We are planning on making it user implemented so the can pick which specific words and definitions to add.

Are there any examples of documatation that you think could help us to structure our project?

For planetscale to we have to add scripts into our backend for the data to be sent planetscale or deleted from planetscale?

How can we refer to the enviremental variables from vercel into the code?
